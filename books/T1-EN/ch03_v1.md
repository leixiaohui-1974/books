# Chapter 3 Architecture of Autonomous Water Networks

> Architecture is where theory becomes operational capability. Without explicit layering, interfaces, and governance hooks, even strong control theory cannot scale to network-level autonomy.

## 3.1 From theoretical principles to implementable architecture

Chapter 2 established the Eight Principles of CHS. This chapter translates those principles into system architecture. The design target is practical: support safe, auditable, and scalable autonomy across heterogeneous hydraulic assets and operational contexts.

## 3.2 WNAL L0-L5 as architecture maturity levels

Water Network Autonomy Levels (WNAL) provide the capability staircase for architecture planning:

- **L0**: manual operation with limited telemetry;
- **L1**: digital monitoring with operator-led control;
- **L2**: assisted control with bounded automation;
- **L3**: conditional autonomy inside explicit ODD;
- **L4**: high autonomy with rare human intervention in predefined domains;
- **L5**: generalized autonomy across broad conditions.

Architecture choices should be made against target level claims, not abstract “smartness.”

## 3.3 HydroOS three-tier architecture

A practical Water Network Operating System (HydroOS) can be described in three tiers:

1. **Device Abstraction Tier**: unifies SCADA endpoints, sensors, actuators, and protocol adapters;
2. **Physical AI Tier**: runs models, estimators, and control optimizers constrained by hydraulic feasibility;
3. **Cognitive AI Tier**: performs interpretation, alert prioritization, explanation, and operator collaboration.

The three-tier split prevents logic coupling and enables independent verification and upgrades.

## 3.4 SCADA+MAS Fusion Architecture

CHS architecture is not “SCADA replacement.” It is SCADA extension through Multi-Agent System (MAS) coordination:

- SCADA ensures deterministic telemetry and command pathways;
- MAS agents coordinate local objectives and global constraints;
- supervisory policies enforce ODD boundaries and Safety Envelope rules.

This fusion model preserves reliability while enabling adaptive coordination.

## 3.5 Runtime safety and governance hooks

Architecture must natively support:

- ODD state evaluation,
- Safety Envelope monitoring,
- policy gating and interlock,
- human takeover triggers,
- immutable audit logging.

If these hooks are bolted on after deployment, architecture debt becomes a safety risk.

## 3.6 Interface design principles

For cross-vendor and cross-region interoperability, CHS recommends three interface principles:

1. **Semantic consistency**: common definitions for state, event, and action objects;
2. **Deterministic command paths**: critical control loops must not depend on best-effort channels;
3. **Versioned contracts**: model/service upgrades require backward-compatible interface control.

[Table 3-1: Minimal interface contract for autonomous operation]
| Interface domain | Required fields | Failure handling |
|---|---|---|
| State telemetry | timestamp, quality flag, source ID, state vector | quarantine invalid streams |
| Control command | target, constraint set, expiration, signature | fallback to safe default policy |
| Safety event | severity, trigger, affected assets, required action | mandatory escalation + logging |
| Human takeover | role ID, reason, scope, timeout | enforce handover confirmation |

## 3.7 Architecture anti-patterns

Common failures in water autonomy programs include:

- treating visualization dashboards as architecture,
- deploying AI services without explicit safety gateways,
- skipping interface governance and relying on ad hoc integration,
- scaling pilots before reproducible in-the-loop verification.

These anti-patterns often produce brittle systems with weak accountability.

## 3.8 Chapter summary and bridge to Chapter 4

This chapter translated CHS principles into architecture patterns: WNAL maturity framing, HydroOS three-tier structure, SCADA+MAS Fusion Architecture, and runtime governance hooks. With architecture defined, the next question is trust evidence. Chapter 4 introduces the verification and validation framework (SIM-SIL-HIL, ODD-based testing, and runtime monitoring).
